## The Panther Lab
The Panther Lab is a small Makerspace located inside the Northwest Branch of the Fort Worth public Library. The lab is open to the public and free to use on a first come first served basis. The lab has three 3D printers, three iMacs loaded with the full Adobe Creative Suite, several different robot learning platforms, a large electronics closet, and many other resources to make, create, or otherwise bring your imagination to life. Visit the [Panther Lab website](http://fortworthtexas.gov/library/programs/makerspace.html) for more information.

## Arduino 101 Ruler
This project is a digital ruler created from the contents of a SparkFun Arduino 101 Inventors kit with the addition of an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and a 1kΩ resistor.
#### Required Parts
* Arduino 101
* Half-size breadboard
* 3.3V 16x2 lcd screen
* 10kΩ trimpot
* HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
* Piezo buzzer
* 1kΩ resistor
* 21 male-male jumper wires
* 6V battery pack (optional for mobile usage)

The ruler can be made just for fun or as the foundation for a more purposeful project or activity. Some possibilities include a parking distance meter for pulling your car into the garage or a replacement for all the lines on the door frame as the kids grow up.

This project can either be tackled individually, or you can attend a class held at the Panther Lab. Refer to the schedule of events on the [Panther Lab website](http://fortworthtexas.gov/library/programs/makerspace.html) for the next available class.
